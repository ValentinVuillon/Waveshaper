This is an audio plugin which can be used in any DAW.

It takes every sample of an input audio signal and remaps the values of the samples with a R->R function. 

The plug-in has two knobs. The first, "Input gain", multiply the input signal by a constant before applying the waveshaping function. The second, Dry/Wet, allows to blend the output signal of the plug-in (wet signal) with the untouched input signal (wet signal=.

I created two version of the plug-in. In the "saturation" version, the used functionn is the following https://www.desmos.com/calculator/afrb5jz5m8

In the "wavefolder" version, the used function is the following https://www.desmos.com/calculator/8pc1whasfg
